      <h3>Who is Conan O'Brien aka Conando</h3>

        <p><strong>Conan Christopher O'Brien</strong> (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, writer, podcaster, and producer. He is best known for having hosted late-night talk shows for almost 28 years, beginning with <em>Night with Conan O'Brien</em> (1993-2009) and <em>The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien</em> (2009-2010) on the NBC television network, and <em>Conan</em> (2010-2021) on the cable channel TBS. Before his hosting career, he was a writer for <em>Saturday Night Live</em> (1988-1991) and <em>The Simpsons</em> (1991-1993)</p>  
        
        <p>Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as "awkward, self-deprecating humor", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the "lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)" With the retirement of David Letterman on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working late-night talk show host active in the United States. This active streak ended with O'Brien's retirement from late-night television in June 2021, with his entire run as a late-night host lasting almost 28 years. Conan was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in 2010.</p>

      
      <h3>Conan's Career History</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>1991: Conan O'Brien works at The Simpsons as a writer and producer.</li>
                
                <li>1993: Conan takes over the Late Night slot from David Letterman. It wasn't a hit right away, but people (people like me, anyway) liked that he was offbeat, and didn't expect him to hit it out of the park right away.</li>
                
                <li>2004: By now, his show is successful -- so successful that as part of his new contract with NBC, Conan is promised the hosting slot at The Tonight Show when Jay Leno retires in 2009.</li>
              
                <li>2009: Jay Leno makes a brave move to prime time, but his efforts tank at first. So he sticks to it and finds his way. Oh no wait, no he doesn't. He made a deal with NBC to have a half-hour show starting at 11:35 p.m., shoving Conan to the 12:05 slot. Conan demurs and takes a $45 million buyout ($12 million of which was earmarked for the staff he moved from New York to LA for the new show).</li>
              
                <li>February 2010: Conan opens his Twitter account TeamCoco. This is the first fans hear from him, since that exit contract put a gag order on him, prohibiting him from appearing on TV.</li>
              
                <li>April 2010: Conan takes a live show on a 30-city tour called “The Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour.” He launches TeamCoco. He also announces that he'll be taking George Lopez's slot on TBS (after getting the thumbs-up from Lopez, whose show will start an hour later).</li>
              
                <li>June 24, 2021: The end of Conan on TBS. Conan will be leaving his talk show to spend time on a new weekly variety series for HBO Max, a new streaming service from WarnerMedia that launched in May 2020. </li>

      <h3>More About Conan</h3>
       
        <h4>Television Producer</h4>
        
        <blockquote>O'Brien was executive producer and co-wrote the pilot of the 2007 NBC adventure/comedy series Andy Barker, P.I., starring O'Brien's sidekick Andy Richter. After six episodes and low ratings, the show was canceled despite being named one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007 by Entertainment Weekly. Later, USA Network handed out a 90-minute, cast-contingent pilot order to the medical-themed Operating Instructions from O'Brien's production banner; O'Brien served as an executive producer through his Conaco label. In January 2010 NBC ordered two pilots from Conaco, the one-hour courtroom drama Outlaw and a half-hour comedy. Outlaw was produced in eight episodes and premiered on September 15, 2010.</blockquote>
        
        <h4>Voice Work</h4>
        
        <blockquote>O'Brien's first guest appearance after beginning his late-night career was playing himself in the season five Simpsons episode "Bart Gets Famous", interviewing Bart Simpson during his rise to fame as a catchphrase comedian. In 1999, O'Brien made an appearance on Futurama in the second-season episode "Xmas Story". O'Brien played himself as a head in a jar and still alive in the year 3000.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>O'Brien has made multiple voice appearances on the Adult Swim series Robot Chicken, including the specials Robot Chicken: Star Wars and Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode II.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Other voice work performed by O'Brien has included the voice of Robert Todd Lincoln in the audiobook version of Assassination Vacation by Sarah Vowell, the voice of talk show host Dave Endochrine in the 2013 DC Universe animated original movie Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (Part 2), the voice of the character Kuchikukan in the "Operation: Lunacorn Apocalypse" episode of Nickelodeon's The Penguins of Madagascar, and the voice of Santa Claus in The Backyardigans episode "The Action Elves Save Christmas Eve"</blockquote>

O'Brien also made a cameo appearance on the U.S. version of The Office. In the episode "Valentine's Day", Michael believes that he spots former SNL cast member, Tina Fey, but has actually mistaken another woman for her. In the meantime, Conan has a quick walk-on, and the camera crew informs Michael when he returns from talking to the Tina Fey lookalike. In 2011, he starred as himself in the web series Web Therapy (opposite Lisa Kudrow) for three episodes. O'Brien also made a guest appearance as himself in the 2019 game Death Stranding, where he communicates with the player using voice lines and facial expressions recorded during his visit to Kojima Productions' headquarters.</blockquote>
