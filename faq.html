    <dl>
        <dt id=2>Is Conan Married?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>Yes. Conan is married to Elizabeth Ann "Liza" Powel O'Brien. O'Brien met Elizabeth Ann "Liza" Powel in 2000, when she appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in an advertising skit involving Foote, Cone & Belding, where she worked as senior copywriter. The couple dated for nearly 18 months before their 2002 marriage in Powel's hometown of Seattle. O'Brien and Powel have a daughter, Neve (born 2003)[149] and a son, Beckett (born 2005).</dd>

        <dt id=3>Where did Conan go to school?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>O'Brien attended Brookline High School, where he served as the managing editor of the school newspaper, The Sagamore. In his second year, he was an intern for Congressman Robert Drinan and in his senior year, he won the National Council of Teachers of English writing contest with his short story "To Bury the Living".</dd>
        <dd>After graduating as valedictorian in 1981, O'Brien entered Harvard University. He lived in Holworthy Hall during his first year with future businessman Luis Ubiñas and two other roommates, and in Mather House during his three upper-class years. He concentrated in History & Literature, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude in 1985. O'Brien's senior thesis, entitled Literary Progeria in the Works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, concerned the use of children as symbols in the works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. During college, O'Brien briefly played drums in a band called the Bad Clams, was a writer for the Harvard Lampoon humor magazine, and developed a spoof of the video game One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird in which the Boston Celtics play against a classical ballet troupe. During his sophomore and junior years, he served as the Lampoon's president. At this time, O'Brien's future boss at NBC, Jeff Zucker, was serving as president of the school newspaper The Harvard Crimson.</dd>

        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>In response to reports that he was as tall as 6 feet 8 inches, talk show host and comedian Conan O'Brien clarified his height by joking, “I'm not radioactive. I'm not growing out of control. I'm 6 feet 4 inches. </dd>

    <dl>
        <dt id=6>Does Conan have any siblings?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>Conan O'Brien has three brothers.
            Neal is the eldest of the O'Brien brothers. For the most part, it seems that he stays out of the public eye and does not work in the entertainment industry.</dd>
    
        <dd>O'Brien's older brother, Luke, followed in the footsteps of his mother to become a lawyer. Currently, he works at Trinity Law Group, LLC, "a Boston-area firm that provides high-end, efficient business counsel to companies, entrepreneurs, and investors" located in Westwood, Mass.</dd>
        <dd>Conan's youngest brother, Justin P. O'Brien, is also an attorney. He's currently a partner at Lovett O'Brien located in Boston, Mass, per his IMDb profile. Before he became a lawyer, Justin had a career in politics — having worked as a political campaign organizer for U.S. senators, Edward "Ted" Kennedy and John Kerry, and a deputy director of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, among other roles.</dd>
        <dd>Conan O'Brien also has two sisters.
            In addition to his three brothers, Conan also has two sisters, Kate and Jane O'Brien. Fun fact: Kate is actually a credited actor in addition to working as a teacher; her acting debut was in The Fighter in 2010</dd>
        <dd>Meanwhile, Conan's sister Jane O'Brien is a producer and freelance writer. She previously worked on The Simpsons as a story editor and an assistant to the producers. Jane wrote an episode of the series titled "Lard of the Dance."</dd>

        <dt id=8>Why did Conan leave The Tonight Show?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show that featured Conan O'Brien as host from June 1, 2009, to January 22, 2010, as part of NBC's Tonight Show franchise. O'Brien had previously hosted NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which followed The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for 16 years, until his brief succession after Leno.</dd>
        <dd>Many members of the Late Night cast and crew made the transition to The Tonight Show. The Max Weinberg 7, the house band from O'Brien's Late Night, served as the house band under the new name, Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. Andy Richter returned to the show as announcer, and also began resuming his role as sidekick, after having left Late Night in 2000.</dd>
        <dd>In January 2010, after the show had been on the air for seven months, it was announced that NBC was intending to move Jay Leno from primetime back to his original timeslot at 11:35 pm, with O'Brien's show starting shortly after midnight. In response to the announcement, O'Brien released a press statement saying that he would not continue as host of The Tonight Show if it was moved to any time after midnight to accommodate The Jay Leno Show. He feared it would ruin the long and rich tradition of The Tonight Show, which had been on after the late local newscasts from the beginning. After two weeks of negotiations, NBC announced that they had paid $45 million to buy out[3] O'Brien's contract, ending both his tenure as host as well as his relationship with NBC after 22 years.</dd>
        <dd>Conan O'Brien's final Tonight Show was broadcast on January 22, 2010, with Jay Leno officially resuming his role as host on March 1, 2010, immediately following the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics. It later received four Primetime Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series, the first time The Tonight Show received a nomination for this particular award after 2003. At only 146 episodes (145 aired) over the course of seven months and three weeks, it is the shortest-running iteration in the sixty-year history of The Tonight Show.</dd>

        <dt id=9>Where did Conan grow up?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>Conan O'Brien grew up in a large, Irish Catholic family in Brookline, Massachusetts.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt id=10>Is Conan retired?</dt>
        <dd><a href="#top">Top</a></dd>
        <dd>Conan is far from retired as he states, "They have no idea that I'm as far from retired as you could possibly imagine." O'Brien is currently focusing on his podcast network which he launched in 2018 and now hosts 11 different shows. He remains tight-lipped after announcing he will be moving to a weekly variety show on HBO Max.</dd>
