While being off the air from The Tonight Show which he resigned from because of trouble with the NBC Network, Conan was seen more with his out grown mustache and beard but his clean shave look has always been his signature look as this head shot shows.

    <h3>Conan And Obama</h3>
    <p>Conan has never strayed from political commentary and in his Podcast Conan Needs A Friend, Conan talks to ex president Barack Obama about the political climate in the world today. In this podcast episode Conan quotes Ulysses S. Grant stating "if we are to have another contest in the near future of our national existence I predict that the dividing line will not be Mason & Dixon . . . but between patriotism & intelligence on the one side & superstition, ambition & ignorance on the other." and both him and Barack discuss it further. This photo was taken from that podcast.
